# Finance-Manager
A simple Java application (with a JavaFX GUI) which can be used to store all financial assets and movements such as Investments, Savings, Income and Costs.
In the 4 categories just mentioned you can add new Subcategories in a separate SubcategoryEditView and have as a summary all displayed in the MainView. The application stores all managed data in a .json file, from which data will also be loaded.

There is a plan to extend the application in the future for a postGreSQL Database implementation with SpringBoot and maybe a Internet deployment.
